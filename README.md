      📄 <b>Description:</b><br>
      <i>This project uses Manim, a Python library for mathematical animations, and LaTeX, a markup language, to create clear visualizations of complex Calculus concepts. These animations aim to make topics more accessible and engaging through interactive content shared on Instagram.</i><br><br>

## How to run the animations?

In environments such as VS Code or Google Colab, you can use Jupyter Notebook to execute Python scripts. To run an animation from the 'Animações' folder, you need to download the corresponding notebook and open it in your preferred IDE. Upon executing the cells, a video will be generated in 1080x1920 resolution, 4K quality, and MP4 format.

> In VS Code, ensure the Jupyter Notebook extension is installed and select a kernel (Python 3.12.6 was used in this project). After running all the cells, the animation will be saved in the "media/jupyter" folder, or you can download it directly from the output cell.

### ![Google Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Colab-%23F9A825.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=googlecolab&logoColor=white) 
> In Google Colab, click "Connect" to establish a connection to the hosted environment and "Restart Runtime" after running the first cell. Unlike VS Code, the execution process is slower, and the animation can be found by clicking the "Files" icon and navigating to the "media/jupyter" folder, where you can download it.
